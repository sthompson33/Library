Created a new branch to test out using a table instead of a grid layout for the list of Books. Ran into an issue with changing the DOM everytime I needed to update  or remove a Book from the list. It became a rather complicated mess to get it styled and make sure each Book property was in the correct grid cell the way I had planned and this seems to be an easier approach.</p>
