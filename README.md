# Library
<p>A tracking program that keeps a list of books that you have read or want to read, along with the authors name and page count. <br>Each book entry gives you several options, such as removing the book from the list or changing it's read status. The catalog section will update after each change to inform you of your current status with the list. This includes the total number of books on the list, the number you have read and some of your most listed authors.

    <li>This included implementing recently learned array functions such as sort</li>
    <li>Ascending or Descending options are available</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Satisfied with some of the design such as..</li>
  <ul>
     <li>Including a tooltip to let the user know about sort options</li>
     <li>Page is split in to two panes, where the left side is fixed and the right is scrollable</li>
  </ul>

</ul>

<h3>Things to Improve On</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Tried implementing some responsive design but needs work</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Need to plan more from the start instead of towards the end</li>
    <li>Need to think from a mobile first standpoint</li>
    <li>Research more about different fonts such as em and rem</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
